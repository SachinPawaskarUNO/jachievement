                <p style="font-size: 16px"> A want versus a need. How to balance a checkbook. Don't you wish that someone had taught you those things as you were growing up? Now there is someone. YOU. All we need is your enthusiasm, life experience, and a willingness to teach children about how you took chances and shot for the stars. Junior Achievement provides the training, curriculum, and a classroom ready to meet you!</p>
